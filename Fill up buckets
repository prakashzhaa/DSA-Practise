>> Discription: 
      Given n buckets and infinite number of balls. The maximum capacity of each bucket is given in an array capacity[]. 
      Find the number of ways to fill the buckets with balls such that each bucket has atleast 1 ball and all the buckets have distinct number of balls in them.


Note: Since the answer may be very large, calculate the answer modulo 10^9+7.

>> Input:
n=2;
arr[]={5,8};

>> Code:

class Solution{
    public int totalWays(int n, int[] arr) {
        // code here
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int mod=1000000007;
        long ans=1;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            ans=(ans*(arr[i]-i))%mod;
        }
        return (int)ans%mod;
    }
    
}

>> Output:
6

>> Explaination:
If the first bucket has 1
ball in it then the second bucket cant have 1 
ball, so the second bucket has 8-1 = 7 choices.
So the first bucket has 5 choices and for each
choice second bucket has 7 choices.
So total there are 35 ways.
